Description: 
    The m6APrediction package provides functions to identify N6-methyladenosine (m6A) 
    modification sites from nucleotide sequences using a Random Forest classifier. 
    It includes tools for DNA 5-mer encoding, single-site and batch prediction, 
    and integrates a pre-trained model to facilitate rapid epigenetic feature screening 
    in RNA-related studies.
